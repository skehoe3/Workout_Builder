# What does this do?
You input 1 of several muscle groups (core, cardio, lower body, or upper body) and the desired number of excercises for that group.  The rest is taken care of! The code will randomly select the specified number of workouts for that group, assign a duration (in seconds), and then read it aloud.  

# Prerequisites
To run this code, you'll need to have the following installed: 

-python3
-numpy
-time
-random
-pyttsx3

That's it!
